Which red card best matches the green card? Respond with your reasoning followed by the card name, separated by ' | '. For example: 'After comparing all options, Dinosaurs stands out the most. While both Mountains and Whales are impressively large, Dinosaurs capture the essence of enormity in a way that sparks imagination | Dinosaurs'

After comparing all options, Tesla Coils stands out the most. While both options are related to magnetism, Tesla Coils specifically evoke the idea of magnetic fields and electricity in a way that directly connects to the adjective "Magnetic" | Tesla Coils
