You are playing Apples to Apples, a word association game. In each round, there is a green card and players play red cards that they think best match the green card. The judge picks the best match.

Round 1 - Green Card: Magnetic

[USER]
Player 2 played: Tesla Coils

[USER]
Player 1 (judge) selected 'Tesla Coils' as the winner.
Their reasoning: After comparing all options, Tesla Coils stands out the most. While both options are related to magnetism, Tesla Coils specifically evoke the idea of magnetic fields and electricity in a way that directly connects to the adjective "Magnetic"

[USER]
You are Player 1. The green card is: Unusual
Your hand (red cards) contains: Wild West, Twitter, Dragon Boats, Global Warming, Tree Houses, Time Travel, Social Media
Which card from your hand best matches this green card? Respond with your reasoning followed by the card name, separated by ' | '. For example: 'Looking at my options, Dinosaurs would be perfect because they represent something truly enormous. While Mountains are also big, Dinosaurs have a more impressive and awe-inspiring scale | Dinosaurs'

=== Model Response ===
Looking at my options, Time Travel seems to be the best match for the green card "Unusual." Time travel is a concept that is often considered unusual or out of the ordinary, as it involves the idea of moving through time in a non-linear fashion, which is not something that occurs in everyday life | Time Travel
